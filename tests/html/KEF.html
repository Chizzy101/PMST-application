                    <h3 class="header-all" style="font-size: 14px;">Legal Description</h3>
                    <p>The Commonwealth marine area is a matter of national environmental significance under the <em>Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</em> (EPBC Act). As such, actions that have, will have, or are likely to have, a significant impact on it require approval.</p>
<p>In February 2014, the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (NOPSEMA) became the sole designated assessor of petroleum and greenhouse gas activities in Commonwealth waters in accordance with the Minister for the Environment&rsquo;s endorsement of NOPSEMA&rsquo;s environmental authorisation process under Part 10, section 146 of the EPBC Act. Under the streamlined arrangements, impacts on the Commonwealth marine area by petroleum and greenhouse gas activities will be assessed solely through NOPSEMA.</p>
<p>Key ecological features are not matters of national environmental significance and have no legal status in their own right. However, they may be considered as components of the Commonwealth marine area.</p>
<p>This KEF was identified in the South-west Marine Bioregional Plan. Under section 176 of the EPBC Act, once a bioregional plan has been made the minister responsible for the environment must have regard to it when making any decision under the Act to which the plan is relevant.</p>
                
                    <h3 class="header-all" style="font-size: 14px;">Values</h3>
                    <p>The continental shelf of the South-west Marine Region contains several terraces and steps which reflect the gradual increase in sea level across the shelf that occurred over the past 12 000 years. Some of these occur as escarpments although their elevation and distinctness vary throughout the region. Where they are prominent, they create topographic complexity, for example through exposure of rocky substrates (Williams et al. 2010), that may facilitate small, localised upwellings due to local acceleration of water movements, benthic biodiversity and enhanced biological productivity.</p>
<p>Benthic biodiversity and productivity occur where the ancient coastline forms a prominent escarpment, such as in the western Great Australian Bight, where the sea floor is dominated by sponge communities of significant biodiversity and structural complexity.</p>
                
                    <h3 class="header-all" style="font-size: 14px;">National and/or regional importance</h3>
                    <p>The Ancient coastline between 90 and 120 m depth is defined as a key ecological feature for its potential high productivity and aggregations of marine life, biodiversity and endemism. Both benthic habitats and associated demersal communities are of conservation value.</p>
                
                    <h3 class="header-all" style="font-size: 14px;">Location</h3>
                    <p>The continental shelf of the South-west Marine Region contains several terraces and steps, reflecting the gradual increase in sea level across the shelf that occurred during the Holocene. A prominent escarpment occurs close to the middle of the continental shelf off the Great Australian Bight at a depth of approximately 90&ndash;120 m.</p>
<p>The spatial boundary of this KEF, as defined on the Conservation Values Atlas, is based on the area between the 90 m and 120 m depth contours derived from the Geoscience Australia bathymetry (Australian bathymetry grid 2009 v4).</p>
                
                    <h3 class="header-all" style="font-size: 14px;">Description</h3>
                    <p>While the ancient coastline is present throughout the region, it is particularly evident in the Great Australian Bight, where it provides complex habitat for a number of species. A prominent escarpment occurs close to the middle of the continental shelf off the Great Australian Bight at a depth of approximately 90&ndash;120 m. Parts of this ancient coastline may support some demersal fish species travelling across the continental shelf to the upper continental slope, thereby supporting ecological connectivity. Benthic biodiversity and productivity occur where the ancient coastline forms a prominent escarpment of exposed hard substrates, such as in the western Great Australian Bight, where it is dominated by sponge communities of significant biodiversity and structural complexity. Large sponges up to one metre across (McEnnulty et al. 2011; Fromont et al. 2011)&mdash;which is remarkable for any discrete colonial animal&mdash;have been recorded from this area; the large individuals at these depths are likely to be many decades old.</p>
                
                    <h3 class="header-all" style="font-size: 14px;">Pressure</h3>
                    <p>During the development of marine bioregional plans, a regional pressure analysis was conducted to assess present and emerging pressures affecting conservation values in the Marine Regions and the effectiveness of mitigation and management arrangements that are currently in place to address these pressures. The analysis enabled pressures to be categorised in terms of their relative importance or concern and has informed the identification of regional conservation priorities. For the purpose of the plans, pressures are defined broadly as human-driven processes and events that do or can detrimentally affect the region's conservation values.</p>
<p>No pressures were assessed as <em>of concern</em> for the Ancient coastline between 90 and 120 m depth.</p>
<p>Pressures assessed as <em>of potential concern</em> are changes in sea temperature, change in oceanography and ocean acidification as a result of climate change, physical habitat modification and extraction of living resources. These pressures are described in more detail below.</p>
<p><strong>Changes in sea temperature (climate change)</strong><br />Sea temperatures have warmed by 0.7 &deg;C between 1910&ndash;1929 and 1989&ndash;2008, and current projections estimate ocean temperatures will be 1 &deg;C warmer by 2030 (Lough 2009). The implications of changes to the region&rsquo;s sea temperatures and oceanography for deeper ocean environments are uncertain, although sea water warming at depth is expected to have significant implications for benthic and demersal fish.</p>
<p><strong>Change in oceanography (climate change)</strong><br />The strength of the Leeuwin Current has decreased slightly since the 1970s. This weakening is expected to continue, although this prediction currently has low confidence (Feng et al. 2009). The Leeuwin Current is the basis of much of the region&rsquo;s biological productivity, and its strength and seasonal/climatic variability are a primary driver for the intensity, timing and locations of productivity events in the region, from the waters off Geraldton to the Great Australian Bight (Pattiaratchi 2007). Numerous water bodies and currents converge at the Naturaliste Plateau, including the subtropical convergence front. These complex water dynamics are likely to experience considerable changes if there are significant changes to ocean circulation in the region, with flow-on effects for the entire ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Ocean acidification (climate change)</strong><br />Driven by increasing levels of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and subsequent chemical changes in the ocean, acidification is already underway and detectible. Since pre-industrial times, acidification has lowered ocean pH by 0.1 units (Howard et al. 2009). Furthermore, climate models predict this trend will continue, with a further 0.2&ndash;0.3 unit decline by 2100 (Howard et al. 2009). Projected changes in Australian waters by 2070 include a decline in pH of 0.2 units (Lawrence et al. 2007). There is a high level of uncertainty about the effects of ocean acidification on marine life. While some organisms might be able to adapt (Orr et al. 2009), anticipated changes to phytoplankton and zooplankton have the potential to detrimentally affect ecosystem processes and the structure of ecological communities. Research on the impact of ocean acidification on Antarctic krill has found that increased levels of CO<sub>2</sub> kill their embryos (Kawaguchi et al. 2011). Krill are an important part of the food chain because they feed on phytoplankton and zooplankton, and are a key food source for many species that occur in Australian waters. Consequently, acidification impacts have the potential to affect species further up the food chain. The potential effects of increased acidity on the region&rsquo;s biodiversity also include changes to growth and population dynamics of some shell-forming organisms, impacts on the reproductive and metabolic functions of a number of fish and invertebrate species, and sensitivity of some early-life stages to acidification (Orr et al. 2009).</p>
<p><strong>Physical habitat modification</strong><br />In the region, disturbance and physical changes to benthic habitats result from bottom trawling, although the extent of trawling varies broadly among the fisheries in the region. Sponges, bryozoans and sea squirts are particularly vulnerable to trawling impacts (Currie et al. 2009). Bottom trawling occurs on the west-coast shelf edge and slope, and loss or modification of the benthic community is likely (20 out of 48 habitat types occurring within the fishery area are at risk; Wayte et al. 2007). Similarly, in the Great Australian Bight, trawling covers limited ground relative to the fishery area but is concentrated on the diverse habitats of the shelf edge and upper slope. Effects of benthic habitat loss on demersal communities and associated ecosystems are not certain. The effects of demersal gillnet deployment over the species-rich benthic communities of this area have not been investigated. The habitats associated with the ancient coastline of the Great Australian Bight at depths of 80&ndash;100 m, although generally not suited to trawling, might also be subject to habitat loss and modification through the impacts of fishing gear. The implications of benthic habitat loss on the region&rsquo;s species and ecosystems are not adequately understood.</p>
<p><strong>Extraction of living resources</strong><br />Understanding of ecosystem effects of fishing is very limited. Evidence of reliance of species on targeted stocks include research on the feeding ecology of seabirds foraging around the Houtman Abrolhos Islands, which indicates that a number of species, including the threatened Australian lesser noddy, are reliant on the availability of specific species of small pelagic fish (Gaughan et al. 2002). Some seabird species that inhabit the region are also known to depend on large pelagic predators, such as tuna, for driving prey fish to the surface, and some species, such as sooty tern, are thought to be totally reliant on this method of feeding (Dunlop 2008; Jaquemet et al. 2007). There are also some concerns, underpinned by high levels of uncertainty, about competition for resources between Australian sea lion and fisheries (DEWHA 2010).</p>
<p>Based on the latest fisheries status reports from the Australian Government, Western Australia and South Australia (respectively, considering the 2009, 2008&ndash;09 and 2006 stock status reports), 10 stocks in the region are assessed as &lsquo;overfished&rsquo;. 16 stocks have an uncertain status, including dhufish, for which substantial declines have been reported (Fletcher &amp; Santoro 2009; Linnane et al. 2010, 2010a; Wilson et al. 2010). Recent management changes have been implemented to facilitate stock recovery for dhufish and other west coast demersal finfish (DoF 2011, 2011a). In light of limited understanding about the ecosystem effects of extraction of living resources for the key ecological features of the region, the pressure is considered <em>of potential concern</em>.</p>
